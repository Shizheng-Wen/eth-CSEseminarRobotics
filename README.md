**Topic**: GNN-based simulation and its application



## Outline

- *The first question to discuss is why we want to learn the simulation?*
  - **Speed**. Weather Forecasting[^1][^2]. Engineereed simulators need substantial effort to build and resources to run.
  - **Generalization**. For engineered simulators. Different problems may need different kinds of simulators, specific simulator is only as accurate as the model. However, learned simulators can be reusable general architectures. Additionally, can be as accurate as teh available data (real-world data).
  - **Differentiability**. Gradient-based search for control[^3], inverse design[^4] and inference, etc.
  - **Learn unkown physics**. compensate for unknown models/parameters: some learned model sub-components can be interpreted [^5]. And there are lots of work (AI for scientific discovery) related to interpretability using symbolic regression.
  - **Distill reusable modules**. Distill a learned model that can be easily deployed on modern accelerator hardware

- *Why GNN? What is the advantage of it?*
  - **Advantage 1:** (<font color=red>most important!</font>) Inductive basis in the Graph make it good at generalization!
    - **Explain:** When we use a machine learning model to approximate a simulator, it is less clear whether the model learn the actual physics (underlying physical equations), or it's just fitting and interpolating a curve? If it just learns a curve, the model will be bad at extrapolation or domain shift of the input distribution. There is no way we can build a dataset that covers the input space of a general-purpose simulator. Therefore, we want to impose inductive biases[^6] to the structure of the learning setup which allows a learning algorithm to prioritize one solution (or interpretation) over another. And GNN is a good candidate to learn the real physics (reusable knowledge, similar to physical laws), and applied far outside the data that it was trained. Also, it is convient to enforce some constraints in the graph.

    - Here, we list some advantages (inductive biases) of GNN[^7] as a physics simulator
      - Inductive bias $\rightarrow$ Prior for generalization: much more efficient and can generalize much better to unseen sencarios. 
        - Permutation equivariance (not ordering, If a MLP, we will impose a ordering inevitably.) 
        - Pairwise message: Pairwise interactions, universal rules
        - message passing framework $\rightarrow$ superposition principle, local interactions, universal rules.

  - **Advantage 2:** message passing framework $\rightarrow$ shared update function for edges and nodes $\rightarrow$ less parameters to train and high Sample and training efficiency.[^3]

- *Therefore, let's introduce the progress of GNN based simulator in these years*

The mainstream framework in this field is the next step prediction model (Autoregressive model)[^8]. Additional, there are two other frameworks including PINN and neural operators, which I will not discuss in this review. Dynamics modeling for particles: $z_{t+1} = z_t + f(t,z_t,u_t)$.

- **GNN-based simulator:**
  - $u^t$: State of the system. Represented as a graph. (mesh, particles, molecules)
    - If the graph is generated by the particle, then the edge is defined by the proximity criterion. 
  - $f_\theta$: message-passing graph neural network
    - shared update function for node and edge

Among 2016-2018, there are a series of work[^7][^9][^10] from Deepmind and MIT, which represents the scene as a graph and model the interactions using graph neural network. However, they only studied relatively small domains: ~10 of bodies, ~100 of steps. 

<img src="assets/image-20230503100036113.png" alt="image-20230503100036113" style="zoom:33%;" />

Can the graph net simulators scale to real-world complexity (orders of magnitude $\rightarrow$ particles and time steps)? In 2019, Li et al.[^11] studied the system with larger system, and achieved the closed-loop feedback control using the learned GNN model (apply model-predictive control optimized using gradient descent.). 

Then, Researchers from DeepMind build the high-quality general-purpose simulator (GNS)[^12] which can simulate the dynamics of fluid, rigid solids and deformable materials. The simulated system is consist of up to 85k particles, and stable for thousands of time steps. Additionally, their work shows strong generalization for larger domains, intial conditions and unseen data. 

However, the limitations of their work is the stability of elastic materials. In GNS, the particle-based model constructed the graph based on proximity creiterion. But some systems are not well established in particles. Can we learn from simulations with connectivity (e.g. FEM)? This is the motivation of meshgraphnet[^13], where the connectivity is already built in the data set. Compared with GNS, the error accumulation is stable for elastic materials (Flagsimple) , no simulation explosion.

GNS and MeshGraphNet are the most importants progress in this field. After that, the community mainly focused on the following two directions:

- **Model improvement**
- **Application of GNN-based solver for downstream task**



==For model improvement, I summarized the following prospectives:==

1. **Control the error accumulation in the iteration**: The key problem for this autoregressive model is that the simulation may explode due to the error accumulation. This can be interpreted as overfitting to the one-step training distribution, and thus being prone to generalize poorly if the input shifts from this, which is usually the case after a few rollout steps. In GNS and Meshgraphnet, the author injected the noise into the training data such that they can better learn the distribution shift. However, this method is not stable and may break down in many cases. Therefore, researchers propose following techniques:

   1. incorporating the temporal model and capture the long-term dependencies[^14]

      <img src="assets/image-20230502174032442.png" alt="image-20230502174032442" style="zoom:30%;" />

   2. Multi-step prediction[^15]: HGNS

      <img src="assets/image-20230502183100380.png" alt="image-20230502183100380" style="zoom:33%;" />

   3. Annealed multi-step learning objective: Graphcast[^16]

      <img src="assets/image-20230503102426040.png" alt="image-20230503102426040" style="zoom:50%;" />

      - ÂÖàÊòØ‰∏ÄÊ≠•ÁöÑÈ¢ÑÊµãÔºåÊ®°ÂûãËÆ≠ÁªÉÂ•ΩÂêéÂÜçÁî®‰∏ÄÊ≠•ÁöÑÊ®°ÂûãÂÅö‰∏§Ê≠•ÁöÑÈ¢ÑÊµã‰ªéËÄåËøõ‰∏ÄÊ≠•ËÆ≠ÁªÉÂáèÂ∞ëmseÔºåÊúÄÂêé‰∏ÄÁõ¥ÊòØ12Ê≠•ÔºåËøôÁßçÊñπÊ≥ïÂèØ‰ª•ËÆ©‰ªñ‰ª¨ÁöÑlossÂáèÂ∞èÁöÑÂæàÂ§ö„ÄÇ

2. **Large-scale**

   1. HGNS[^15]: Super large-scale simulation: realistic 3D scenarios with up to 1.1 million cells per time step (two orders of magnitude higher than prior models).
      1. Apply the sector-based training, which allows HGNS to learn on datasets with at least two orders of magnitude more nodes than GNS - This is mainly due to the reason that no matter GNN and Unet, it has the characteristics of the local interaction: `both the SGNN and the 3D- U-Net are ‚Äúlocal‚Äù models, meaning that to predict the cell‚Äôs state at ùë° + 1, we only need a cell‚Äôs neighbors up to a certain distance away, instead of the full grid. Based on this observation, we partition the full grid into ‚Äúsectors‚Äù`
   2. GraphCast[^16]: Super-scale: 1, 038, 240 nodes. Every nodes have 227 variables. In total, the state representation contains 235, 680, 480 values.

3. **Higher Resolution (multiscale)**

   1. MultiScale MeshGraphNets[^16][^17][^18]: The idea is very simple. Because the message-passing is local, which can only capture the local interaction. Build graph with different resolutions to capture the long-range interactions.

      <img src="assets/image-20230502223422712.png" alt="image-20230502223422712" style="zoom:50%;" />

4. **Encode more physics priori into the GNN for better accuracy** 

   1. Pure data-driven deep learning models suffer from error accumulation and poor generalizability when predicting complex physical processes. A more promising way is to leverage our prior physics knowledge in scientific deep learning models. Encoding Physicals (PDE), symmetry and conservations law in the GNN to enforce the roboustness of the GNN. There are many methods combined in this field, including the PINN (weakly enforcement), and Mike, han gan et al. have works in this field. I won't discuss the physics priori as the loss function in this review. **I will mainly focused on the hard enforcement, that is encoding the physics priori knowledge into the neural network architecture.**

   2. Conservation of Momentum[^19]: when simulating the particle dynamics, the conservation of momentum is especially important

   3. Symmetry[^20][^21]: The data inherently have the symmetry information.

      <img src="assets/image-20230503104751284.png" alt="image-20230503104751284" style="zoom:25%;" />





==For Application of GNN-based solver for downstream task, I sorted out the following prospectives:==

1. **Robotics control (Sim-to-Real)**:  

   1. RoboCraft[^22]:*Learn the model from the observed data by camera in the real word.* And use the learned model to manipulate the elasto-plastic objects. The manipulation process is based on the control model in this paper. `Learning Particle Dynamics for Manipulating Rigid Bodies, Deformable Objects, and Fluids`
      - Training data collection:
        - ~12 seconds for a trial (3 grips) $\times$ 50 trials = ~**10 minutes** of training total
   2. GGNS[^23]: *Use the real world data to fix the GNN simulator.* 

2. **Inverse Design**: 

   1. inverse design of boundary and system parameters[^24]:First paper that used GNN for inverse design
      1. Because we know that the learned GNN model is Differentiable. We can do inverse design which combines learned forward simulators based on graph neural networks with gradient-based design optimization. In this paper, the author designed surfaces and tools to manipulate fluid flows and optimizing the shape of an airfoil to minimize drag.

   2. State/parameter Estimation[^25]: inferring unknown system states/parameters

      1. optimize MSE[$\hat{u}^t(x),u^t(x)$] w.r.t. initial state $u^0$ or parameter $a$, given sparse observation of $u^t(x)$ at certain locations $x\in\Omega$

    - train on 1 step, rollout 1000s steps
  - **Training:** trained with 1-step prediction, minimizing MSE. To improve long-term prediction, add Gaussian noise on the input. <img src="assets/image-20230402181503776.png" alt="image-20230402181503776" style="zoom:25%;" /> 
  
    - $\epsilon \sim N(0,1), \sigma$: amplitude of noise on each feature
  
  - **Results:**
  - Very good at simulating fluid-like stuff, hard to simulate elasticity. That is reason why they propose meshgraphnet subsequently.
    - **Generalization:** learn some underlying physics, not just interpolating or overfitting. Generalization to significantly more particles.
      - Inductive biases:
        - shared node, edge functions: dynamics is the same for all particles
        - Relative encoding: absolute position is never observed. Only position difference to neighbors
      - Effects:
        - Reduced input space, observing translational symmetry
        - Effectively more train data; each particle is a "sample"
        - Less likely to overfit, more likely to generalize out-of-distribution
    - **Key architectural choices:**
      - Message passing steps + connectivity radius: performance/accuracy tradeoff

#### High-Resolution (Multiscale GNN)

- **MultiScale MeshGraphNets**. *Meire Fortunato, Tobias Pfaff, Peter Wirnsberger, Alexander Pritzel, Peter Battaglia*. **ICML 2022 AI4Science Workshop** ([PDF](pdf/GNN-multiscale_meshgraphnet.pdf))
  - **Motivation:** MeshGraphNets relies on a message passing graph neural network to propagate information, and this structure becomes a limiting factor for high-resolution simulations, as equally distant points in space become further apart in graph space. Therefore, the author introduce a hierarchical approach (MultiScale MeshGraphNets) which passes messages on two different resolutions (fine and coarse), significantly improving the accuracy of MeshGraphNets while requiring less computa- tional resources.
